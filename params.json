{"name":"Shinydata","tagline":"An intuitive graphical user interface for interactive data analysis, visualization and presentation","body":"shinyData (Beta)\r\n=========\r\n\r\nshinyData is intended to be an easy to use tool for interactive data analysis, visualization and presentation.\r\n  It leverages the power of R and its vast collection of packages to allow users to efficiently perform common\r\n  data tasks, such as slicing and dicing, aggregation, pattern recognition, visualization and more.\r\n  Almost no knowledge of R programming is required to use shinyData.\r\n  \r\n  Note: shinyData is currently under active development. Interested users are encouraged to try it out, but should not \r\n  use it for production purposes.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\nTo run the web based version of shinyData without installing anything, simply go to https://roose.shinyapps.io/shinyData/. \r\nTo install the package locally, execute the following R code (you can use the same code to get updates as well): \r\n```\r\nif(!require(devtools)) install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"yindeng/shinyData\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n```\r\nshinyData::shinyData()\r\n```\r\nThis will open your default browser and run shinyData locally on your computer.\r\n\r\nTo quickly get a flavor of what shinyData can do, simply open one of the sample projects in the dropdown box on the \"Project\" page.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
